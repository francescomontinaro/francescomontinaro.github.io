_When you were a tadpole and I was a fish
<br/>
In the Paleozoic time,
<br/>
And side by side on the ebbing tide
<br/>
  We sprawled through the ooze and slime,
  <br/>
Or skittered with many a caudal flip
<br/>
  Through the depths of the Cambrian fen,
  <br/>
My heart was rife with the joy of life,
<br/>
  For I loved you even then..._

### About me ###
I am Francesco Montinaro, currently a Post-Doc researcher at the **Institute of Genomics** of *the University of Tartu*.
 <br/>
 As a Natural Science undergraduate In Bologna, I have used to dream about being a field researcher, maybe in some warm and tropical country. I did'nt know though, that during my Postgraduate studies (Biodiversity & Evolution in *Bologna University*) I would fall in love with genetics and evolution, and that this would have me brought in Estonia, one of the coldest (and coolest) place of Europe. I have discovered that looking only at a bunch of letters interspersed in the blueprint of an individual, I could be able to decode events that occurred million of years ago, well before the apperance of that same species on earth.
<br/>
From that moment, a rush to acquire all the skills needed for evolutionary analysis started: I had to get familiar with statistical notions, coalescent theory and, importantly *the art of coding*. I am still running, collecting successes and failures in the *fantastic creepy world of Academia*, but with the same immutable passion...
<br/>
Also, I love insects, and I kept some stick bugs during my postgrads. The coevolutionary history of **dogs** and **humans** fascinated me so much that I have ended up loving them (the dogs...of course!).
